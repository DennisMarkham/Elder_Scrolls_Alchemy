# Elder_Scrolls_Alchemy
In the Elder Scrolls series of video games, alchemy is accomplished by combining two different ingredients.  Every ingredient has four potential effects.  If the two ingredients match in any of these effects, they will create a potion with that effect.  For example, if you combined wheat, whose effects are:
-restore health
-invisibility
-resist fire
-resist frost

with lavender, whose effects are:
-fortify conjuration
-restore health
-restore fatigue
-restore magicka

You would get a "restore health" potion.
